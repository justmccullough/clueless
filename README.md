# Clueless
A VB6 game I created in high school. Posting it here just for fun. I wrote a blog post here: https://justinmccullough.me/revisiting-my-roots

This is mostly for posterity. I did get it to run when I installed an old copy of VB6 Enterprise. The installer doesn't install the necessary VB6 runtime. There is a DAL.dll in the Bin folder that I had to add as a reference to run it from within the IDE. Everything else worked.

I plan to do 0 maintainance with it so enjoy :)
